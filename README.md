<!-- About Project -->

## ***About the Project***
<br />

#### **Project Description:**

<br/>
<br/>

<!-- Getting started -->

## ***Getting Started***
<br />

### **Installation** 
<br />

1. ### Forking
  
      Fork the sushiksha-first-contributions Repository with the help fo the <b>FORK</b> button of the top right corner of the repository. 

2. ### Cloning

      1. Once Forked, click on the Green colored <b>CODE</b> button
      2. Make sure you have <b>https</b> selected and copy the url shown.
      3. Open GitBash on your system and use ```cd``` command to navigate to the desktop or whichever folder you want to clone the repository to. Here I will clone to my Desktop 

      In Windows
      ```bash
      cd Users/UserName/Desktop
      ```

      *For Linux or MacOS users, please refer the official documentation.*

      4. Now to clone the Repository.

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/sushiksha-first-contributions.git
      ```
      5. Now ```cd``` into that folder.

      ```bash
      cd sushiksha-first-contributions
      ```

      *PS: you can also choose to download a zip file of the code that is an option under the green code button as well. however this can cause problems in the development process sometimes. So proceed with caution!*

  <br />

*Congratulations! you have Successfully Cloned your First Repository!!!*

  <br />

### **Development**
<br/>
 
 *PS: from hereon, please ensure you are working in your cloned repository. Otherwise the below commands will not work.*

3. ### Checkout

      Branches are unique features of Version Control Systems that allow you to add/remove features and test them individually, without affecting the main code. This also enables multiple contributors to work on a single piece of code together, working on multiple features.

      You should never work on the main branch of you repository and reserve it for deployment purposes. You should, instead, checkout to another branch where you can make your changes and then push it to the main branch to be merged into

      you can do this easily with the ```checkout``` command. This command can be used with a flag ```-b``` to create a new branch as well. By default your main branch is main. all other branches will have to be created by you.

  Initially to create a new branch, you will have to use the ```-b``` flag. Rest of the times, you can just checkout to it provided it hasn't been deleted.

  ```bash
  git checkout -b your-branch-name
  ```


  Checking out to it the next time.

  ```bash
  git checkout your-branch-name
  ```

4. ### Editing
  
  This is the working part of the code. Here is ideally where you would make changes to the source code on your local system. But for thsi project, we've made it simple for you!

  Follow the following steps to make yourself a nice card under your team name for the website!
